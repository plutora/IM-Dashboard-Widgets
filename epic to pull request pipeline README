The JS file uses the mermaid library to link an Epic to User Stories to Pull requests

The Change Type has these 3 literal values in it
A Change was created of type epic and the Change ID is hard coded on line 71

Changes of type User Story are imported via the Jenkins adapter with the Type set by default to user story
For the purposes of the demo the User Stories are linked to the Epic by hand but in the future we plan
to map them via a JIRA ID which is stored in JIRA ID Additional Info field

Changes of type Pull Request are imported via an integration hub job to pull Open Pull Requests from GIT
For the purposes of teh demo the Pull Requests are linked to a hard coded Change ID on line 559 of
the integration hub job github-to-changes.js

The images to the write suggesting packaging and deployment details are simply an image
